	\begin{itemize}

		\item The Advanced Training Initiative (\ati) by the Economic
			and Social Research Council (\esrc) provided grants to
			support training in advanced social science topics.

		\item We were funded to provide a series of workshops on Bayesian data analysis each year for the years 2015, 2016, \& 2017:\\

		\item Each workshop was limited to around 25 attendees, and could be attended by any UK based social science researchers (post-graduate students and above).

		\item There was a minimal fee of \pounds20 per workshop, with a \pounds10 fee for students. There were bursaries to support travel and accommodation expenses by students.

		\item We taught 4 workshops in 2015, 6 (or 9) in 2016, and 6 (or 9) in 2017\footnote{The reason for and details of the extra workshops in 2016 and 2017 will be explained.}.
